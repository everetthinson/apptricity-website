<div class="pull-quote">&ldquo;We look forward to the opportunity to participate in SCOPE Spring as a Premier Sponsor and to share the extensive experience we&rsquo;ve gained by addressing critical industry challenges&rdquo;, said Timothy D. Garcia, founder and CEO, Apptricity.</div>

<p>Apptricity® Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise solutions for supply chain management (SCM) and spend management, today announced its plans to exhibit and present at SCOPE Spring 2015, the top executive-level event for the supply chain industry. Key Apptricity supply chain experts will be available at booth 201 to share their knowledge and experience and answer questions.</p>

<p>Held in Baltimore, Md., at the Hilton Baltimore April 26 – 28, 2015, this year&rsquo;s SCOPE conference promises to provide a rich experience for attendees. A compelling and practical educational program, networking opportunities, panels, presentations, and real-world insights and case studies set the stage for learning, process improvements and emerging partnerships.</p>

<p>Mark Oliver, executive vice president, Apptricity, will present Adapting Your Business to the Age of Now by Improving Supply Chain Management Efficiency. His presentation will cover Supply Chain Execution Convergence (SCEC), the merging of critical supply chain elements and procedures.
