<p>Apptricity<sup>&reg;</sup> Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise solutions for <a href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/">supply chain management</a> (SCM) and <a href="/solutions/spend-management/">spend management</a>, today announced that MCAP has selected Apptricity for multiple, integrated solutions including <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/expense.html" title="Apptricity Expense"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Expense</a>, <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/invoice.html" title="Apptricity Invoice"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Invoice</a> and <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/purchasing-requisition.html" title="Apptricity Purchasing"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Purchasing</a>.</p>

<div class="pull-quote">&#8220; “We are pleased that MCAP selected our Spend Management Suite,” said Tim Garcia, Apptricity President and CEO. “Our solution will provide automated solutions that can easily be accessed and used via the web or any mobile device. MCAP leaders will now gain real-time visibility and invaluable business intelligence to benefit their fiscal health and operational efficiency.

<p>MCAP is one of Canada’s leading independent mortgage financing companies providing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and construction loans. Apptricity was selected through a RFP process to provide an automated solution for Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders (POs) and employee expense. Apptricity was selected from 25 vendors evaluated because it provided: a solution that allowed MCAP to keep its data in Canada; mobile capability for invoicing and employee expense; strong integration between the products and MCAP’s systems; an efficient user interface; and a high level of adaptability to meet their specific needs.</p>

<p>MCAP was seeking a scalable solution to support growth of the organization. The solution needed to improve the controls on expenses, support process optimization through reporting and analytics, provide key metrics, and be easy to use.</p>

<p>Apptricity’s automated solution will provide greater visibility into MCAP’s business units helping to improve decision making and cost control. <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/invoice.html" title="Apptricity Invoice"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Invoice</a> will improve the invoice payment process from receipt to disbursement of funds. <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/purchasing-requisition.html" title="Apptricity Purchasing"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Purchasing</a> will automate the PO process from creation through to the procurement, deployment and receipt of the Invoice. <a href="../../solutions/spend-management/expense.html" title="Apptricity Travel and Expense"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Travel and Expense</a> will automate the employee expense process from the capture of expense information through to the payment of the expense to the employee.</p>
