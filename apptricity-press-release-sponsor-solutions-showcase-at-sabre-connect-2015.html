Experienced expense management professionals will be ready at booth 26 with a live demo of <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html"><strong><em>Apptricity</em></strong> Expense</a>, an advanced solution that seamlessly integrates expense management with travel booking for vast efficiency increases.</p>
<p>Held in Las Vegas at Red Rock Resort on June 2-4, 2015, Sabre Connect 2015 enables executives to connect with innovative technologies, understand current trends and their impact, and learn from some of the most influential leaders in corporate travel worldwide. The event includes breakout sessions, networking, and opportunities to discuss critical topics and gain advice. A number of Sabre affiliates share their solutions via the Solutions Showcase, which enables attendees to meet with product experts and discover critical technologies that will help determine the future of business travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our relationship with Apptricity gives our customers another integrated option for travel expense management,&rdquo; said Yannis Karmis, vice president of corporate solutions for Sabre. &ldquo;We are delighted to showcase the <strong><em>Apptricity</em></strong> Expense platform during our upcoming Connect 2015 in Las Vegas.&rdquo; <em>Expense</em> seamlessly integrates GetThere, Sabre&rsquo;s powerful travel booking system, with Apptricity&rsquo;s comprehensive corporate expense management solution. This tight integration streamlines and simplifies travel booking and expense processing. End users book all flight, rail, hotel and car rental reservations through GetThere by logging into <em>Expense</em>. <em>Expense </em>then automatically converts completed booking information to expense line items for reporting purposes. The results are dramatic time and cost savings, efficient and accurate reporting, and peace of mind for busy corporate travelers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Apptricity, we value Sabre as a preferred integration partner. We are very pleased to participate as a sponsor of this event,&rdquo; said Timothy D. Garcia, founder and CEO, Apptricity. &ldquo;Saving steps through innovation and streamlining the user experience have long been a part of Apptricity&rsquo;s mission to meet the needs of end users with technology. We look forward to sharing this powerful, time-saving solution made possible by Sabre and GetThere.&rdquo; All GetThere functionality — including the ability to verify and change travel booking details — is accessible from the <em>Expense</em>interface. Within <em>Expense</em>, the streamlined travel booking and expense entry process occurs in real time in a single step that eliminates the need to navigate between multiple Web browsers.</p>
