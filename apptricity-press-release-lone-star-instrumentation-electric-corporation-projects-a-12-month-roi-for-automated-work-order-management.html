<h1>Lone Star Instrumentation &amp; Electric Corporation Projects a 12-Month ROI for Automated Work Order Management</h1>

<p>(PRWEB) February 26, 2015</p>

<p>Apptricity<sup>&reg;</sup> Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise software for supply chain management and integrated financial management, today announced that Lone Star Instrumentation &amp; Electric Corporation has estimated a 12-month return on investment (ROI) for its successful implementation of Apptricity Work Order Management. Deployed in June 2014, this solution replaces manual procedures with automation and saves time and money by giving Lone Star start-to-finish control of work order processing.</p>

<p>Lone Star supports the oil, gas, petrochemical and mining industries with instrumentation and electrical services. In its quest for continuous process improvement, the organization sought a solution that would address the large amount of paperwork coming in from the field. Field services technicians were using handwritten worksheets, and the same data was entered manually several times. Work orders, time sheets and invoicing all involved time-consuming manual effort.</p>
<p>Apptricity Work Order Management transformed Lone Star&rsquo;s labor-intensive procedures by providing an automated system that includes tablets for mobile connectivity with technicians in the field and Web-based tracking and control for the offices. The system is integrated with Lone Star&rsquo;s accounting software to streamline invoicing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before, if we could get everything billed out within two to three weeks, it would be a miracle. Now we&rsquo;re in real time. We can have invoices in the mail prior to paying our employees, which is huge when you&rsquo;re talking the volume of business we&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; said Ronnie Hobbs, president and CEO, Lone Star. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still rolling out tablets every day to different areas, so it continues to get better. We might have our complete return in less than 12 months or right around the 12-month mark. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s a 12-month ROI on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The system tracks each work order and records labor hours while assigning fees to the appropriate accounts. Deployment via the cloud gives Lone Star real-time updates across all of its offices, replacing time-consuming mailing and faxing. The Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery model also provides the data security Lone Star needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to deliver an automated solution that strengthens Lone Star&rsquo;s service offering,&rdquo; said Timothy D. Garcia, founder and CEO, Apptricity. &ldquo;Now that Lone Star&rsquo;s work order processing and billing are automatic and scalable, they will not hold the company back from expanding its reach to additional customers and new locations. Lone Star&rsquo;s success is indicative of what Apptricity seeks to provide for both local and global organizations across every industry it serves. We give companies an advanced platform and the scalability to grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easy to configure, Apptricity Work Order Management readily adapts to an organization&rsquo;s business processes. A user-friendly interface enables personnel to create and assign service requests, prioritize work orders according to predefined specifications, determine service dates, and assign work orders to specific employees. By including budgeted hours or costs with each work order, organizations can keep services within budget and maintain profit margin.</p>
