<h1>Apptricity Announces Impressive Results for 2014</h1>

<p>Global provider of mobile enterprise software exceeds 2013 revenue by 20 percent</p>

<p>(PRWEB) March 05, 2015</p>

<div class="pull-quote">The ability to deploy our solutions in the cloud or in a customer&rsquo;s data center has helped us be even more successful replacing other vendors, said Garcia, CEO, Apptricity. &ldquo;We also make it easy for customers to transition between licensing options.</div>

<p>Apptricity® Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise software for supply chain management and integrated financial management, today announced revenue growth of approximately 20 percent in 2014. The earnings results exceeded expectations. Notably, the company renewed more than 95 percent of its Software as a Service (SaaS) contracts that were scheduled for renewal.</p>

<p>Apptricity® Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise software for supply chain management and integrated financial management, today announced revenue growth of approximately 20 percent in 2014. The earnings results exceeded expectations. Notably, the company renewed more than 95 percent of its Software as a Service (SaaS) contracts that were scheduled for renewal.</p>

<p>Apptricity saw a significant increase in competitive replacement wins. According to Timothy D. Garcia, founder and CEO, Apptricity, &ldquo;We offer both SaaS subscriptions and perpetual licenses, and these options appeal to organizations desiring flexibility. The ability to deploy our solutions in the cloud or in a customer&rsquo;s data center has helped us be even more successful replacing other vendors. We also make it easy for customers to transition between licensing options.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apptricity continues to see rapid adoption of its asset, inventory, work order and expense management solutions. Expense management in particular is in high demand. The company&rsquo;s comprehensive solution suites can address everything from a single function to enterprise-wide supply chain management (SCM) and financial management.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to deliver out-of-the-box and customized solutions to our clients depending on their needs,&rdquo; said Garcia. &ldquo;Apptricity was architected so a customer&rsquo;s business would run the software, not according to the traditional model where the business has to adapt to the software architecture. With the traditional route, companies can lose their competitive advantage and best practice unless they pay heavily for professional services to re-architect the software. Apptricity was created to trump this traditional approach with highly customizable solutions that adapt to clients&rsquo; business needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garcia attributes the company&rsquo;s success to an ongoing investment in people, mobile technology and global expansion. Apptricity&rsquo;s technology infrastructure and implementation methodology are additional success factors, dramatically shortening time-to-benefit and giving customers an extremely rapid return on investment (ROI).</p>

<p>As part of its global business strategy, Apptricity opened its European headquarters in May 2014. Located in London, the office provides extended service and support for EMEA while making support options available across time zones for customers worldwide. Apptricity&rsquo;s European headquarters also enables the company to establish and strengthen partnerships for its global Apptricity Partner Program.</p>
