<h1>Companies Continue Selecting  Apptricity Travel and Expense Management to replace IBM Global Expense Reporting Solution (GERS)</h1>
<p>Successful GERS migrations, leading edge technology, and mobile solutions help solidify decisions</p>

<p>Dallas, Texas  (PRWEB) September 28, 2015</p>

<p>Apptricity<sup>&reg;</sup> Corporation, a leading global provider of innovative mobile enterprise solutions for <a href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/">supply chain management</a> (SCM) and <a href="/solutions/spend-management/">spend management</a>, today announced that companies continue selecting <strong><em>Apptricity</strong></em> <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">Travel and Expense Management</a> to replace IBM Global Expense Reporting Solution (GERS).</p>

<div class="pull-quote">&#8220;Each month, we continue to migrate new clients from GERS to Apptricity Travel and Expense,&#8221; said Tim Garcia, President and CEO.</div>

<p>IBM announced in May 2014 that it would retire or sunset its long time GERS solution by December of 2015 as well as choosing to partner with Concur. In another twist, IBMs competitor SAP acquired Concur in December 2014 in one of the biggest cloud technology acquisitions in history.  These events have created major disruption and confusion in the Travel and Expense Management Market.</p>

<p>However, IBM&#39;s announcement to delay the sunset of IBM GERS to March 2016 created even more competitive replacement opportunities for Apptricity. Apptricity had been replacing other solutions that weren&#39;t providing quality customer support, leading edge technology and mobility. Apptricity has been a leading Travel and Expense Management provider for over 15 years and they continue to be the first to market with new technological advancements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each month, we continue to migrate new clients from GERS to <strong><em>Apptricity</strong></em> Travel and Expense,&#8221; said Tim Garcia, President and CEO.  &#8220;Clients are telling us that they chose us because our product is extremely easy to use for the end user, the manager and the auditor. They also are pleased with our proven track record of successful GERS migrations, our easy to use mobile application and our client references&mdash;and not to forget our award winning customer support. The market confusion has created new opportunities for Apptricity to feature our superior Travel and Expense Management solution.&#8221;</p>
